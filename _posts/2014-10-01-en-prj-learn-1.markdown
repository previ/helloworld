### Description
CoderBot is lost in the maze and does not know how to exit. 
We know the path, but we can communicate with it only with simple instructions: forward, backward, turn right, turn left.
If it wasn't enough, we can send just one message, before the robot starts.
Will we succeed in saving it?
In order to solve this problem, it will be required to define the correct path, decompose it in basic instructions and translate them in a sequence, that the robot will execute.

### Requisites
A plain space of about 2 by 2 meters.
A few objects easily moveable on the surface, such as boxes or books, to define the maze.
Some paper and color pens, to draft the path and the instructions

### Preparation
Participants are split in two groups with different roles. During the game, the groups will swap roles so that everyone will experience the same activities.
Group "A" prepare the maze, which must provide a starting point and a reachable exit.
Group "B" prepare the robot's program.

### The game
Group "A" has prepared the maze with available obstacles. They must try to build the most difficult, yet "open" maze.
Group "B" analyse the maze, draws a path to let it exit.
The path must than be converted in elementary actions: forward, turn, and so on. First on paper, then on code that is directly programmed in the robot.
There is a finite number of trials and a limited time to test the program, then the groups swap roles.
The "programmers" team gets a point if the robot was able to escape the maze. In case of parity, the team that achieved the quickest escape wins.
